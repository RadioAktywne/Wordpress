# You can put setup scripts here

# To ensure they are executed in correct order,
# you should prepend the filename with a number higher than the previous one.

# For example setup scripts could be named like:
# - 01-configure-theme.sh
# - 02-remove-bloatware.sh

# You should only execute things here that are stateless,
# because this scripts will run on every restart,
# regardless of what's the current state of data.

# If you changed some functionality that was in use before,
# and there is data created during the old functionality,
# you probably need to migrate that data.
# To do that, you should create a migration script
# and put in in migrations directory.

# This setup script is empty, but you can keep it in source control.
# This way we are sure that the directory with setup scripts exists.
